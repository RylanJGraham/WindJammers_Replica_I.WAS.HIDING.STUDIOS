# Windjammers - I WAS HIDING STUDIOS

## Description

Windjammers is an arcade sports game, in which the main objective of it is to win your opponent
in a head-to-head flying disk match. Windjammers is based on classic volleyball/handball matches 
but adds a frenetic point of view when playing it due to its special features such as the goals, 
score points, unique characters and special courts.

## Contributions

Even though each group member had a role, we all participated in the process of coding the game and its different stages. By doing this, we all work in different stages of the game and the work is not only easire but faster dividing the coding tasks between all of us.
